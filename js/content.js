        paragraphs: ['The websites I used for research all mostly had simple and easy to read fonts; like sans seriff or gill sans. I wanted to use this convention and therefore used the font ‘inter’ for the website. It has a high readability, easy on the user’s eyes but also looks aesthetically pleasing for the text. The theme of the website is currency rates thus there was no need to use a fancy font but just an easy to read but decent looking font.'],

            'Using the feedback from Assignment 3, I changed the styling and user interface. For the homepage, the content is structured towards the centre but for the other webpages, the content is aligned from the left to the right. ',
             'The feedback suggested that I centre the homepage content and when I tried the centre layout, I realised that it was much easier to read the headings and paragraphs compared to having it structured on the left. The aim of the homepage is to capture the user’s attention with brief sentences thus when the content is in the centre, it looks more attention grabbing instead of them being forced to read from the left corner to the right. ',
             'I decided to keep the left alignment for the other webpages but only after I went to do some research. For my research, I looked at how current currency rate exchanges and forex trade websites, such as Oanda, Xe and Avatrade structured their content. They have important information that needs to be explained centred from the left but keep lots of white space between paragraphs and headings to rest the user’s eyes. Following the same principle, the structure I planned for the other webpages was to have a big heading, on the left followed by a brief paragraph with an image next to it. ',
             'In the feedback, the problem of navigating through content heavy webpages was brought up. To solve this, I decided to have a small table of contents after the first heading so that instead of scrolling down, the user can click on what they want to read instantly. After they are done reading, they can click on the up arrow on the bottom right corner of the screen and go back up to look for something else. ',

            'To improve the UI and layout of the website, I did a lot of research looking at forex websites. Most of them used blue, black and sometimes grey as their primary colours. The backgrounds are in white and interaction points are mostly blue to grab the user’s attention. I also decided to use this convention but settled on a blue colour palette with a light shade of beige and a light beige grey. ',
            'These are mostly soft but muted bright colours. They work well with the colour white. The user’s eyes won’t hurt when they see these colours and I used them as backgrounds for the webpage’s headings and footer. To relax the user’s eyes while reading text, I kept most of the backgrounds as white. The colours were used for points of interaction to grab the user’s attention to avoid overwhelming the user.

            'From the feedback from assignment 3, it was pointed out that the website was minimalistic and the theme was unclear. For the exam, I decided to add more images to reinforce the theme along with the text. Therefore, I added images to the data visualization interaction points and for the other webpages. For example, the first data visualization is a graph for the latest rates thus I added an image of bars with currency rates below it.'],

        paragraphs:[
            'In assignment 3, it was also pointed out that the points of interaction lacked visual feedback, not communicating that this can be clicked. Therefore, I made the colours of the buttons or interactable words a bright blue shade and hovering above it would change the background and text colour. The buttons all have a border radius to give it a rounded shape and look friendly to interactive with. The table of contents at the top of the content heavy webpages are also coloured blue to match their corresponding headings that are also coloured blue. Hovering on the navigation interactive text, changes the colour of the text and also displays a panel with more options to choose from. '],
